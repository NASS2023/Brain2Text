# Problem Statement

In todayâ€™s rapidly advancing technological landscape, there exists profound need to bridging communication gap for individuals facing speech impediments. This project makes an attempt to interpret brainwaves and decipher meaningful information that brainwaves convey. We would be using innovative deep learning frameworks and transformer architectures to find a novel and  interpretable mapping between brainwaves and the corresponding information conveyed in the form of text.![image](https://github.com/NASS2023/Brain2Text/assets/141930141/f182ef82-2e6f-4afb-bf46-ab2fb1dcaf6e)
